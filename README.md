## 📌 Best Practices

- Optimize images before uploading
- Use descriptive class names
- Validate HTML using W3C Validator
- Keep CSS modular and scoped
- Use version control (Git) actively
- Write meaningful commit messages

---

## 📈 SEO Considerations

- Use meaningful page titles and meta tags
- Add alt text to all images
- Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<section>`, `<article>`)
- Create a sitemap.xml (optional)

---

- Contact form currently has no backend validation
- Do not expose API keys in JS
- For production use, sanitize any form data if you add backend processing

---
